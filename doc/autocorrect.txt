*autocorrect.vim* insert mode autocorrect


Overview~

What makes this autocorrect plugin different than others? The difference is
that every single misspelling in this plugin has actually occurred by me in
practice. This is essentially a list of every misspelled word that I've had in
Vim over the last few years. As it turns out, there are many ways to mangle
some common words. 

This list is not generated by any script. It doesn't just do common
transpositions, etc. 

I'd had a mapping to help me do this quickly and that mapping is included in
this plugin as well. 

Basic Usage~

To load the autocorrect file, you can use the command 'LoadAutocorrect'.

:LoadAutocorrect

If you'd like to quickly add your own autocorrect entry to your personal
autocorrect file, you can use the mapping <leader>aa. 

By default, the file is stored in ~/.autocorrect. You can change the location
of this directory by using the variable g:autocorrect_dir. For example, you
could store it at 

:let g:autocorrect_dir=C:/Users/mpaulus/myspelldir


How it works~

The main file is just a long list of iabbrev commands.

Inherently, this is a very personal project/plugin. It order to maintain it's
purity, I'm going to be the only one adding in new iabbrevs. But you can
expect this list to only grow and become more comprehensive as time goes on,
and it will continually be getting updated.
